# Swatch (a "custom switch statement" for C#)

Based on my blog post at [http://mohundro.com/blog/2011/01/10/a-custom-switch-statement-in-c/](http://mohundro.com/blog/2011/01/10/a-custom-switch-statement-in-c/.).

Per a request in a comment, I'm putting this code up on GitHub.

## Getting set up

The code currently targets [.NET Core 1.0 preview 2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

Once .NET Core is installed, you can run `dotnet restore` to get all of the dependencies loaded.

## Running the sample app

```
cd src/App
dotnet run
```

## Running the tests

```
cd test/Swatch.Tests
dotnet test
```
